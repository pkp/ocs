		<![CDATA[<p>To ensure the submissions to the conference have been properly prepared in content and form for processing, the Author must satisfy a number of steps as configured by the Conference Manager in Scheduled Conference Setup Step 2 and Website Management Step 1. These requirements include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Selecting which track to submit the abstract or presentation to;</li>
			<li>Agreeing to (checking off) items of agreement in a submission checklist (this list can be modified by the Conference Manager, and can be removed completely);</li>
			<li>Agreeing to a copyright notice (the Author may have to physically check their agreement, if enabled by the Conference Manager in Website Management Step 1);</li>
			<li>Entering any additional comments to the Director (optional).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Once this step is complete, the submission will appear in the Author's active submission queue. If the Author does not complete the entire submission process, it will appear as "Incomplete".</p>]]>
