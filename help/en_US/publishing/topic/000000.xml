		<![CDATA[<p>Conference publishing is a matter of ensuring that all accepted submissions are sent to the Presentations list; that all presentations have appropriate galley files and supplementary files uploaded, if applicable; that their submission metadata, including their abstract, is vetted; and that the submissions are scheduled. Depending on the Conference Timeline settings, the Conference will eventually be archived; the submissions will still be available online, but the scheduled conference will no longer be listed as a current conference.</p>]]>
