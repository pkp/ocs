		<![CDATA[<p>The Director can see all presentations in review by clicking the In Review link on the Director's User Home page. Clicking on a presentation's title will bring the Director to the current submission abstract or paper Review page, depending on how the scheduled conference has been set up and how far along the review process is. The Director will be able to: assign one or more Reviewers to the submission by clicking the Select Reviewer link; record a Director decision and notify the author under Director Decision; send the submission from Abstract Review to Paper Review, if both steps are being used; send  the submission to the Presentations list by clicking the Complete button; and upload optional layout galleys and supplementary files under the Layout heading for presentation on the scheduled conference website. </p>]]>
