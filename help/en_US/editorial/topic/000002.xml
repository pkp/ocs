		<![CDATA[<p>The Track Director is involved in a submission's progress from Review to Presentation (or Archiving). Track Directors have access only to those submissions to which they have been assigned. Track Directors can be assigned directly to a track so that any submissions to that track are automatically placed in their Review queue; or Directors may assign submissions manually.</p>]]>
