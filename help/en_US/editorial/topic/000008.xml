		<![CDATA[<p>If logging has been enabled by the Conference Manager in Website Management Setup Step 5, the History Page will contain a number of relevant logs, as well as a submission notes section, where the Director can add private notes regarding the submission.</p>
		<p>The logs include an Event Log, which details actions committed to the submission from author submission onwards; an Email Log, which lists every email sent from one user to another concerning the submission, and its contents; and Submission Notes.</p>
		<p>All log entries can be viewed and purged individually, and each log can be cleared at any time.</p>
		<p>Please note that clearing a log will only affect the log for that particular entry -- not for all logs across a scheduled conference.</p>]]>
