		<![CDATA[<p>If a presentation is submitted to a conference track that does not have a Track Director assigned to it, the presentation will be listed in the Director's Unassigned queue. To assign the presentation, the Director can click the Unassigned link on their User Home page; click the submission title; and then choose to assign either another Director or Track Director, or Assign Self. Clicking the Add Track Director link displays a list of Track Directors available, with their names, conference tracks, and the number of completed and active assignments. Click on "Assign" under Action in the entry of a Track Director, and a prepared email will be generated to that Track Director. When a submission is assigned to a Track Director, it will move from the Unassigned queue to the In Review queue.</p>]]>
