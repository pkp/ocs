		<![CDATA[<p>All submissions to the conference fall into one of the four queues under Submissions on the Director Home page, depending on what phase they are currently at in the editorial process. The Director can overview how many submissions are unassigned, how many are in review, how many are accepted as presentations, and how many are in the archives, and is authorized to make changes to any of these files.</p>]]>
