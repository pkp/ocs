		<![CDATA[<p>Clicking on Archives on the Director Home page will take the Director to the scheduled conference's Archives page. Submissions in this queue are those that have been rejected before moving further ahead in the editorial process, or have been archived along with a scheduled conference. Conferences that have been archived by the Director can be deleted using the Delete link next to their name in this queue.</p>
		<p><em>To Restore an Archived Item to the Active List.</em> The Director should go to the Archives on the Director's Home page and find the submission. Clicking on the submission's title will lead to the Summary, Review and History pages for the submission, and on the Summary page there is a link, "Restore to Active List," that will move the submission into the In Review or In Editing list, depending on what stage the submission was at when it was archived.</p> ]]>
