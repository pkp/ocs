		<![CDATA[<p>OCS is a multilingual system, allowing conferences to publish in a variety of languages. It also provides for multilingual support, making it possible to display the entire interface in multiple languages. Available languages are listed on the Languages page in the Site Administration area, and can be configured from there. Conference Managers can enable all languages that have been installed by the Site Administrator. If more than one language is selected as a supported locale and saved, users will be able to toggle between languages for many site fields, and will be able to choose a display language from a language select menu on the sidebar. Thusly, it is possible for users to view the conference and to enter data in any supported language.</p>]]>
