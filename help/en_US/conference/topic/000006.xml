		<![CDATA[<p>The Scheduled Conference page lists all scheduled conferences you have created, whether they are current or archived. You can create a new scheduled conference from this page by clicking the Create a Scheduled Conference link: this leads to a page where the new scheduled conference title, acronym and path need to be filled in. When this is finished, the newly-created conference will be listed in the Scheduled Conferences list, and it and all its management options will appear under Current Conferences on the Conference Site Management page. </p>]]>
