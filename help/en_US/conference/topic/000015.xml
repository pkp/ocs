		<![CDATA[<p>The Conference Manager can control all aspects of the scheduled conference timeline from this page. Dates can be set for the conference start and end date; for promoting the conference or moving it to the archive; for author registration and submission acceptance time frames; and for reviewer registration. </p>
		
		<p>The Conference Manager can also set if and when accepted abstracts, accepted papers and the schedule are posted to the website; whether there will be a delay for open access to presentations;  when comments, if permitted, will be closed; and if the conference timeline will be posted.</p>
		<p>The system will return an error message if you create an "impossible" scheduling situation, ie. if you schedule the conference to be archived before the last day of the conference. Error messages can be overridden by the Conference Manager by scrolling to the bottom of the page after receiving one, and checking the Override Error Message(s) box.</p>]]>
