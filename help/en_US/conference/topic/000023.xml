		<![CDATA[<p>The Conference Manager has the option of enabling either Manual Fee Payment or PayPal Fee Payment, which determines whether registrants will encounter a PayPal or a Manual Fee Payment page wherever they wish to make a payment to attend the conference.</p>
		<p><em>Manual Fee Payment</em>. If this option is selected, cheques, money orders, credit card information submitted by mail, telephone, etc. can be used. Conference Manager will validate the payment before the registration is active.</p>
		<p><em>PayPal Fee Payment</em>. If this option is selected, major credit cards as well as eChecks can be used. A PayPal Business Account needs to be activated and IPN URL and Seller Account information should be filled in. </p> ]]>
