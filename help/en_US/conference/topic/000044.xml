		<![CDATA[<p>The first step to setting up a scheduled conference involves getting down the preliminary details. These details include  a brief description and overview of the conference; the conference venue; principal contact and technical contact information; names of organizations and contributors sponsoring the conference; and a customized email signature and email bounce address can be specified. (To use the bounce address function, the "allow_envelope_sender" option in OCS' config.inc.php must be enabled.)</p>]]>
