		<![CDATA[<p>The Conference Manager must first select which conference tracks to use for compiling statistics. More than one track can be chosen by holding down the Control keyboard button while clicking. When the Record button is clicked, statistics for the selected tracks will be shown in the list below. Calendar years can be cycled through by clicking the forward and backward buttons on either side of the date.</p>
		<p>The Conference Manager can also export unique reports from the system. Supported reports include a papers report (listing all papers in the system); a registrant report (listing all scheduled conference registrants); and a review report (listing all submission review information). These are available in CSV (comma-separated-value) format.</p>  ]]>
