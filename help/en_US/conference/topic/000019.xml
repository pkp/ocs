		<![CDATA[<p>The Import/Export Data feature allows the Conference Manager to inject data into and extract data from OCS.</p>
		<p>Data import/export is implemented using plugins, with each format or type of data being provided by a different plugin. For more information, refer to each plugin's documentation, found within OCS' plugin directory.</p>
		<p>Currently, two Import/Export plugins ship with OCS as documented below. More options for importing and exporting will be developed in future OCS versions.</p>
		<p>Import/export functionality is also available as a command-line tool; see tools/importExport.php for more information.</p>]]>
