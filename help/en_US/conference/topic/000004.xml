		<![CDATA[<p>This conference system uses a number of traditional conference publishing roles to carry out the editorial process. One person can be registered in more than one capacity, so that the conference could, for example, be run by one person serving in all roles except Reviewer and Author. More typically, a Conference Manager may also serve as a Director and a Track Director. Reviewers are often registered as Authors.</p>
		<p><em>Access limited by role</em>. Users have different rights and permissions depending on which roles they are assigned to. For example, Authors and Reviewers go into their own individual space within the conference's website; and Track Directors are only allowed to see the submissions to which they have been assigned. A Director, however can see all submissions to the scheduled conference, but cannot see submissions to other scheduled conferences.</p>]]>
