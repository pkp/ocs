		<![CDATA[<p>The Conference Manager's role is to manage three main items: the hosted conference website; scheduled conferences within that website; and users related to the hosted conference. The Conference Manager is responsible for the initial conference setup by working out its scope, timeline, tracks, program, times and locations for presentations and events, submission and review guidelines, etc., and handling registration issues. The Conference Manager has access to several management pages to configure the conference site, such as Email Templates, Reading Tools, Files Browser, System Plugins, etc., and can check site and conference status by viewing the Event Log and Conference Statistics pages.  Finally, the Conference Manager can enroll existing users or create new users, and manipulate user accounts.</p>
