		<![CDATA[<p><em>Scheduled Conference Redirect:</em><br /> Any requests to the hosted conference will redirect to the selected scheduled conference.  This setting is typically used when the conference holds a single scheduled conference.</p>
		<p><em>Homepage:</em><br /> This is to add flavour to your conference home visually and verbally, by uploading an image and adding extra information. The Additional Content field will accept HTML and will display under the homepage image, if one has been uploaded.</p>
		<p><em>Information for Users:</em><br /> OCS provides default information for Readers and for Authors. This information can be modified. It appears under the Information heading  on the right sidebar.</p>
		<p><em>Announcements:</em><br /> Announcements can be enabled here; whether they appear on the home page, and in what number, can be set. Only Conference Managers can make announcements: if they are enabled, a link to add a new announcement will appear on the Conference Site Management page. </p>
		<p><em>Access to Conference Presentations:</em><br /> Three options are for allowing access to conference presentations - to anyone indiscriminately, to those who have accounts with conference website, or to registered conference participants only. </p>]]>
