		<![CDATA[<p>The Files Browser allows the Conference Manager to create new directories and to upload files directly. Files can be viewed, downloaded, and deleted as if interacting with a local file system. </p>
		<p>Note that this is intended as an administrative facility only and will generally not be needed in the day-to-day management of the conference. Submission information is maintained as a combination of files and database records; deleting submission files with the Files Browser will not delete the associated database records.</p>]]>
