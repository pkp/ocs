		<![CDATA[<p>The third step to setting up a scheduled conference concerns all aspects of the review process. This is broken into three main sections. </p>
		
		<p><em>Review Policy:</em><br /> The scheduled conference's review policy is outlined for readers and authors and will appear on the conference's About page.</p>
		<p><em>Peer Review:</em><br /> Review guidelines are specified here, and are made available to Reviewers when they enter the review process. Additionally, the Conference Manager can specify how the Reviewer interacts with the submission files, how much time they have to access the files, and how often they are reminded of the review if it hasn't been completed. There is also an option to allow Directors to rate Reviewers on a five-point scale. </p>
		<p><em>Director Decision:</em><br /> This determines whether the Notify Author email will go to all submitters or only the primary contact (only valid when there are more than one submitter).</p>]]>
