		<![CDATA[<p>Reading tools are turned off by default, but can be activated by following these steps: click on the Reading Tools link on the Conference Site Management page; on the Reading Tools page, click the Reading Tool Settings link; on the Reading Tool Settings page, check the Enable checkbox; choose the appropriate Related Items Field from the dropdown menu; and finally, choose any Optional Tools as desired. </p>
		<p>The Reading Tools engage readers in many aspects: they not only enable the readers to access the abstract and supplementary files of conference presentations, but can also provide bibliographical detail, indexing metadata, and printer-friendly versions; they allow users to quickly look up word definitions online by double-clicking a word in a presentation; they search relevant subject databases for references and citations linked to the presentation; provide author biography and contact information; and provide the option for emailing the article to a contact, or commenting on the presentation itself.</p>
		<p>Once activated, the Reading Tools will appear in a frame beside all published items that have been designated for indexing. The Conference Manager is able to edit or delete existing Reading Tools resources and add new ones as well. See {help_topic key="user.readingTools" text="Reading Tools"} under Conference Web Site.</p>]]>
