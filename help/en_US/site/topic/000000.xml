		<![CDATA[<p>This conference management and publishing system is designed to be installed and administered on a local web server. Once installed, the Site Administrator can use it to create as many individual conferences as are required, and oversee the administration of each conference that is created. OCS allows you to host either a single, one-time conference or several conferences from the single installation, each of which may occur repeatedly over years. </p>]]>
