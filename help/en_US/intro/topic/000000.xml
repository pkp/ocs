		<![CDATA[<p>Open Conference Systems (OCS) is an open source solution to managing and publishing scholarly conferences online. OCS is a highly flexible management and publishing system that can be downloaded for free and installed on a local Web server. It has been designed to reduce the time and energy devoted to the clerical and managerial tasks associated with managing a conference, while improving the record-keeping and efficiency of editorial processes. It seeks to improve the scholarly and public quality of conference publishing through a number of innovations, from making policies more transparent to improving indexing. </p>]]>

	<section title="System Background">
		<![CDATA[<p><em>OCS is a conference management and publishing system</em>. OCS covers all aspects of online conference management and publishing, from setting up conference website to operational tasks such as submitting, reviewing, editing, publishing, archiving, and indexing of the conference papers. OCS also helps to manage the people involved in organizing a conference, including keeping track of the work of directors, track directors, reviewers, and authors, notifying readers and registrants, and assisting with the correspondence.</p>
		<p><em>OCS is flexible and scalable</em>. A single installation of OCS can support the operation of multiple conferences, and multiple years for each conference. Each conference has its own unique URL as well as its own look and feel. OCS can enable a single director to manage all aspects of a conference, or OCS will support an international team of people with diverse responsibilities for a conference's various aspects.</p>
		<p><em>OCS supports the principle of extending access</em>. This system is intended not only to assist with conference publishing, but also to demonstrate how costs of conference publishing can be reduced to the point where providing readers with "open access" to the contents of proceedings may be a viable option. The concept of open access is elaborated in a number of articles stemming from this project which are freely available under <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/pkp_publications" target="_blank">PKP Publications</a> on Public Knowledge Project website.</p>
		<p><em>The origins of OCS</em>. Largely based on the existing code used for <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs" target="_blank">Open Journal Systems</a>, OCS was developed to meet the needs of scholarly conference organizers. OCS is a research and development initiative of the Public Knowledge Project at the University of British Columbia. Its continuing development is currently overseen by a partnership among UBC's Public Knowledge Project, the Canadian Center for Studies in Publishing, and the Simon Fraser University Library. For more information, see the <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/" target="_blank">Public Knowledge Project</a> web site. The latest version of OCS is 2.1, released in April 2008. OCS has been used by over 100 scholarly conferences, as shown by <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/ocs-conferences" target="_blank">OCS Conferences</a> on the PKP website. </p>
